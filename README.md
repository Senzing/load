# load

If you are beginning your journey with [Senzing],
please start with [Senzing Quick Start guides].

You are in the [Senzing Garage] where projects are "tinkered" on.
Although this GitHub repository may help you understand an approach to using Senzing,
it's not considered to be "production ready" and is not considered to be part of the Senzing product.
Heck, it may not even be appropriate for your application of Senzing!

## Synopsis

`load` is a command in the
[senzing-tools](https://github.com/senzing-garage/senzing-tools)
suite of tools.
This command can pull records from a variety of sources and insert into the Senzing database.
